# L2Projection2D
This is  a Pyhon script to evaluate L2 projection Pf(x) for a given function f(x) in 2D.<br />
The main file is <L2Projection2D.py> <br />

The following results for 32 elemnts (25 nodes) in the domain [-1,1]^2. <br />

<br />
which gives the mass matrix: <br />

<br />

f(x,y)= sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2))
<br />
Note: you can shange the function from main file.<br />
